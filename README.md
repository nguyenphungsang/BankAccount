# BankAccount
The code defines three classes: BankAccount, SavingAccount, and CheckingAccount. BankAccount is the parent class and has basic methods for depositing, withdrawing, and transferring money between accounts. SavingAccount is a child class of BankAccount and adds a method for calculating interest based on the account balance and interest rate. CheckingAccount is also a child class of BankAccount and adds a transaction count variable and a method for deducting fees if the number of transactions exceeds the number of free transactions.

In the main method, three accounts are created with initial balances. Some deposits and withdrawals are made, as well as transfers between accounts. Finally, the fees for account3 are deducted and the balances of all three accounts are printed.
